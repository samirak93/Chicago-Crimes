## CHICAGO CRIMES
### Predicting crimes in Chicago and creating an crime alert.

We’re using the Chicago Crime Dataset from 2012-2017 for this analysis. 

We’re predicting crime using FB Prophet. 

There is also an crime alert system that would alert nearby crimes based on given user Location.

The code can be viewed here : [Code Link](https://samirak93.github.io/Chicago-Crimes/Chicago_Crime_Project.html)
